AWS SAA: Key Concepts

- Only a subset of services in SAA exam
- Only need to how they work together, no need to know implement details
- Only focusing on how to achieve well performaing, scaleable, secure and cost effective designs.

## Key Concepts

### Durability vs. Availability

Durability

- addresses the question, “Will my data still be there in the future?”
- e.g., a file copies to two sites, copies to three AZs

Availability

- addresses the question, “Can I access my data right now?”
- e.g., in one site, we keep two copies of one file

Amazon S3 is designed to provide both very high durability and very high availability for your data.

### High availability VS Fault tolerance

**High availability**:

- hardware, software and configuration that allowing a system to recover quickly in the event of a failure.
- The key part is the recover quickly.
- It doesn't prevent a failure from occurring and it doesn't stop that failure from impacting customers.
- The primary aim of high availability is to minimize downtime and recover quickly.
- It aims to minimize downtime and recover quickly in the event of a failure.
- E.g., for a car, if one tyre broken, we have a backup tyre, it may break down, but can be fix quickly

**Fault tolerance**:

- a system designed to operate through a failure with no user impact.
- generally more expensive and more complex to achieve and do so reliably
- E.g., a plane. If one engine down, plane can still operate normally

### RPO VS RTO

RPO, recovery point objective

- how much a business can tolerate to lose, expressed in time. The maximum time between a failure and the last successful backup.
- E.g., you revoced backup data after data center exploded, you lost the mose recent 1 hour data before exploding.

RTO, recovery time objective

- The maximum amount of time a system can be down. How long a solution takes to recover.
- E.g., website can be online again 1 hour after the data center exploded...

### Scaling

- Vertical: addign more resources to a server, e.g., add additional CPU. However, there is a limit. requires reboot of server.

- horizontal: add more machines. No size limitation. Done without outage. More complicated.

- Elasticity, elastic capacity: scale out and in a system, as demand requires. Help to achieve cost optimizatin and performance efficientcy.

### Availability Zones vs. AWS regions

Regions

- AWS infrastructure Regions meet the highest levels of security, compliance, and data protection.

AZs

- highly available, fault tolerant, and scalable.
- AZs are within 100 km (60 miles) of each other.

## AWS Well-Architected Framework

### Software Architecture Best Practices

tenets of architecture best practices

- Design for failure and nothing will fail.
- Implement elasticity.
- Leverage different storage options.
- Build security in every layer.
- Think parallel.
- Loose coupling sets you free.
- Don’t fear constraints.

Best practices for designing and operating reliable, secure, eﬃcient, and cost-effective systems in the cloud.

The **AWS WellArchitected Tool** (AWS WA Tool) is a service reviews and measures your architecture whether using the AWS WellArchitected Framework, and provides recommendations for making your workloads more reliable, secure, eﬃcient, and cost-effective.

Definitions:

- Component: code, configuration and AWS Resources that together deliver against a requirement. Normally decoupled.
- Workload: a set of componetns. It's the detail the business and tech leaders communicate about.
- Milestones: key changes in your architecture
- Architecture: how componetns work together in a workload
- Technology portfolio: the collection of workloads that are requried for business to operate

Five pillars:

1. **Operational Excellence**: The ability to run and monitor systems
2. **Security**: protect infomation, systems and assets
3. **Reliability**: system recover from failure
4. **Performance Efficientcy**: use computing resources efficiently
5. **Cost Optimization**

You may need to optimize

- to reduce cost, downgrade reliability of dev env
- for mission critical solution, optimize reliability with increased costs
- In ecommerce solutions, performance should be optimized
- Security and operational excellence are generally not traded-off against the other pillars.

### General Design Principles

- Stop guessing your capacity needs: n use as much or as little capacity as you need, and scale up and down automatically.
- Test systems at production scale: only pay for the test environment when it's running
- Automate to make architectural experimentation easier: use Automation to avoid the expense of manual eﬀort.
- Allow for evolutionary architectures: the capability to automate and test on demand lowers the risk of impact from design changes
- Drive architectures using data: collect data, make fact-based decisions and improve workload.
- Improve through game days: simulate events in production which will help you understand where to improvement.

### Pillar One: Operational Excellence

It includes the ability to run and monitor systems to deliver business value and to continually improve supporting processes and procedures.

**Design Principles**:

- **Perform operations as code**: deﬁne your entire workload (applications, infrastructure) as code, limit human error and enable consistent responses to events.
- **Annotate documentation**: automate the creation of annotated documentation after every build
- **Make frequent, small, reversible changes**
- **Reﬁne operations procedures frequently**
- **Anticipate failure**: Test your failure scenarios
- **Learn from all operational failures**

**Three best practice areas**: Prepare, Operate, Evolve

### Pillar Three: Reliability

It includes the ability of a system to recover from infrastructure or service disruptions, dynamically acquire computing resources to meet demand, and mitigate disruptions such as misconﬁgurations or transient network issues.

Design Principles

1. Test recovery procedures: test how your system fails, and you can validate your recovery procedures.
2. Automatically recover from failure: automatic notiﬁcation and tracking of failures, and for automated recovery processes that work around or repair the failure.
3. Scale horizontally to increase aggregate system availability: don't share a common point of failure.
4. Stop guessing capacity
5. Manage change in automation

Key Service

The AWS service that is essential to Reliability is Amazon CloudWatch, which monitors runtime metrics.

3 Best Practices:

1. Foundations: foundational requirements that inﬂuence reliability should be in place

### Pillar Four: Performance Efficientcy

the ability to

1. use computing resources eﬃciently to meet system requirements,
2. and to maintain that eﬃciency as demand changes and technologies evolve.

Design Principles

1. Democratize advanced technologiesanscoding and mechine learning
   - Rather than having your IT team learn how to host and run a new technology, they can simply consume it as a service. E.g., NoSQL databases, media transcoding, and machine learning.
   - In the cloud, these technologies become services.
2. Go global in minutes
   - serverless architectures remove the need for you to run and maintain servers.
   - For example, storage services can act as static websites, removing the need for web servers,
   - and event services can host your code for you.
3. Use serverless architectures
4. Experiment more often
5. Mechanical sympathy

3 Best Practices:

1. Selection, the four main resource types that you should consider (compute, storage, database, and network).
   - Compute is available in three forms: instances, containers, and functions:
     - Instances
     - Containers: a method of operating system virtualization that allow you to run an application and its dependencies in resource-isolated processes.
     - Functions: abstract the execution environment from the code you want to execute.
   - Storage:
     - vary based on the kind of access method (block, ﬁle, or object), patterns of access (random or sequential), throughput required, frequency of access (online, oﬄine, archival), frequency of update (WORM, dynamic), and availability and durability constraints.
     - The optimal storage solution for a particular system will vary based on the kind of access method (block, ﬁle, or object), patterns of access (random or sequential), throughput required, frequency of access (online, oﬄine, archival), frequency of update (WORM, dynamic), and availability and durability constraints.
     - As with storage, it is critical to consider the access patterns of your workload, and also to consider if other nondatabase solutions could solve the problem more eﬃciently (such as using a search engine or data warehouse).
   - Database:
     - vary based on requirements for availability, consistency, partition tolerance, latency, durability, scalability, and query capability.
     - Amazon RDS, DynamoDB, Redshift
     - As with storage, it is critical to consider the access patterns of your workload, and also to consider if other nondatabase solutions could solve the problem more eﬃciently (such as using a search engine or data warehouse).
   - Network
     - vary based on latency, throughput requirements
     - AWS offers product features (for example, Enhanced Networking, Amazon EBS-optimized instances, Amazon S3 transfer acceleration, dynamic Amazon CloudFront) to optimize network traﬃc.
     - AWS also offers networking features (for example, Amazon Route 53 latency routing, Amazon VPC endpoints, and AWS Direct Connect) to reduce network distance or jitter.
2. Review
3. Monitoring
   Amazon CloudWatch provides the ability to monitor and send notiﬁcation alarms. You can use automation to work around performance issues by triggering actions through Amazon Kinesis, Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS), and AWS Lambda.

4. Tradeoffs
   - AWS also offers caching solutions such as Amazon ElastiCache, which provides an in-memory data store or cache,
   - and Amazon CloudFront, which caches copies of your static content closer to end users.
   - Amazon DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) provides a read-through/write-through distributed caching tier in front of Amazon DynamoDB, supporting the same API, but providing sub-millisecond latency for entities that are in the cache.

Key Service

The AWS service that is essential to Performance Eﬃciency is **Amazon CloudWatch**, which monitors your resources and systems, providing visibility into your overall performance and operational health.

1. Selection
   - Compute: Auto Scaling is key to ensuring that you have enough instances to meet demand and maintain responsiveness.
   - Storage: Amazon EBS provides a wide range of storage options (such as SSD and provisioned input/output operations per second (PIOPS)) that allow you to optimize for your use case. Amazon S3 provides serverless content delivery, and Amazon S3 transfer acceleration enables fast, easy, and secure transfers of ﬁles over long distances.
   - Database: Amazon RDS provides a wide range of database features (such as PIOPS and read replicas) that allow you to optimize for your use case. Amazon DynamoDB provides single-digit millisecond latency at any scale.
   - Network: Amazon Route 53 provides latency-based routing. Amazon VPC endpoints and AWS Direct Connect can reduce network distance or jitter.
2. Review: The AWS website are resources for learning
3. Monitoring: Amazon CloudWatch provides metrics, alarms, and notiﬁcations.
4. Tradeoffs:
   - Amazon ElastiCache, Amazon CloudFront, and AWS Snowball are services that allow you to improve performance.
   - Read replicas in Amazon RDS can allow you to scale read-heavy workloads.

### Pillar Five: Cost Optimization

the ability to run systems to deliver business value at the lowest price point.

5 Design Principles

1. Adopt a consumption model
   - Pay only for the computing resources that you require and increase or decrease usage depending on business requirements.
   - Stopping test environments saves 75% cost
2. Measure overall eﬃciency
3. Stop spending money on data center operations
4. Analyze and attribute expenditure
   - transparent attribution of IT costs to individual workload owners.
   - This helps measure return on investment (ROI) and gives workload owners an opportunity to optimize their resources and reduce costs.
5. Use managed and application level services to reduce cost of ownership
   - remove the operational burden of maintaining servers for tasks such as sending email or managing databases.

4 Best Practices

1. Expenditure Awareness
   - Using AWS Budgets, you can send notiﬁcations if your usage or costs are not inline with your forecasts.
   - You can use tagging on resources to apply business and organization information to your usage and cost; this provides additional insights to optimization from an organization perspective.
   - Combining tagged resources with entity lifecycle tracking (employees, projects) makes it possible to identify orphaned resources or projects that are no longer generating value to the organization and should be decommissioned.
   - You can set up billing alerts to notify you of predicted overspending, and the AWS Simple Monthly Calculator allows you to calculate your data transfer costs.
2. Cost-Effective Resources
   - Using the appropriate instances and resources for your workload is key to cost savings.
   - **On-Demand Instances** allow you to pay for compute capacity by the hour, with no minimum commitments required.
   - **Reserved Instances** allow you to reserve capacity and oﬀer savings of up to 75% off On-Demand pricing.
   - With **Spot Instances**, you can leverage unused Amazon EC2 capacity and oﬀer savings of up to 90% off On-Demand pricing.
   - **Spot Instances** are appropriate where the system can tolerate using a ﬂeet of servers where individual servers can come and go dynamically, such as stateless web servers, batch processing, or when using HPC and big data.
   - Appropriate service selection can also reduce usage and costs; such as **CloudFront** to minimize data transfer, or completely eliminate costs, such as utilizing **Amazon Aurora** on RDS to remove expensive database licensing costs.
3. Matching supply and demand
   - you can automatically provision resources to match demand.
   - Auto Scaling and demand, buffer, and time-based approaches allow you to add and remove resources as needed.
4. Optimizing Over Time
   - Managed services from AWS can signiﬁcantly optimize the workload, e.g., running an Amazon RDS database can be cheaper than running your own database on Amazon EC2.

Key AWS Services

The tool that is essential to Cost Optimization is **Cost Explorer**, which helps you gain visibility and insights into your usage, across your workloads and throughout your organization.

1. Expenditure Awareness
   - **AWS Cost** Explorer allows you to view and track your usage in detail.
   - **AWS Budgets** notify you if your usage or spend exceeds actual or forecast budgeted amounts.
2. Cost-Effective Resources
   - use **Cost Explorer** for Reserved Instance recommendations, and see patterns in how much you spend on AWS resources over time.
   - Use **Amazon CloudWatch** and **Trusted Advisor** to help right size your resources.
   - You can use Amazon Aurora on RDS to remove database licensing costs.
   - **AWS Direct Connect** and **Amazon CloudFront** can be used to optimize data transfer.
3. Matching supply and demand
   - **Auto Scaling** allows you to add or remove resources to match demand without overspending.
4. Optimizing Over Time. AWS websites are resource.
